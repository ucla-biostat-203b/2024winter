## Q1. Git/GitHub

**No handwritten homework reports are accepted for this course.** We work with Git and GitHub. Efficient and abundant use of Git, e.g., frequent and well-documented commits, is an important criterion for grading your homework.

1. Apply for the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) at GitHub using your UCLA email. You'll get GitHub Pro account for free (unlimited public and private repositories).

2. Create a **private** repository `biostat-203b-2024-winter` and add `Hua-Zhou` and TA team (`Tomoki-Okuno` for Lec 1; `jonathanhori` and `jasenzhang1` for Lec 80) as your collaborators with write permission.

3. Top directories of the repository should be `hw1`, `hw2`, ... Maintain two branches `main` and `develop`. The `develop` branch will be your main playground, the place where you develop solution (code) to homework problems and write up report. The `main` branch will be your presentation area. Submit your homework files (Quarto file `qmd`, `html` file converted by Quarto, all code and extra data sets to reproduce results) in the `main` branch.

4. After each homework due date, course reader and instructor will check out your `main` branch for grading. Tag each of your homework submissions with tag names `hw1`, `hw2`, ... Tagging time will be used as your submission time. That means if you tag your `hw1` submission after deadline, penalty points will be deducted for late submission.

5. After this course, you can make this repository public and use it to demonstrate your skill sets on job market.

## Q2. Data ethics training

This exercise (and later in this course) uses the [MIMIC-IV data v2.2](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/), a freely accessible critical care database developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology. Follow the instructions at <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/> to (1) complete the CITI `Data or Specimens Only Research` course and (2) obtain the PhysioNet credential for using the MIMIC-IV data. Display the verification links to your completion report and completion certificate here. **You must complete Q2 before working on the remaining questions.** (Hint: The CITI training takes a few hours and the PhysioNet credentialing takes a couple days; do not leave it to the last minute.)

## Q3. Linux Shell Commands

1. Make the MIMIC v2.2 data available at location `~/mimic`. 
```{bash}
#| eval: false
ls -l ~/mimic/
```
Refer to the documentation <https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/> for details of data files. Please, do **not** put these data files into Git; they are big. Do **not** copy them into your directory. Do **not** decompress the gz data files. These create unnecessary big files and are not big-data-friendly practices. Read from the data folder `~/mimic` directly in following exercises. 

  Use Bash commands to answer following questions.

2. Display the contents in the folders `hosp` and `icu` using Bash command `ls -l`. Why are these data files distributed as `.csv.gz` files instead of `.csv` (comma separated values) files? Read the page <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/> to understand what's in each folder.

3. Briefly describe what Bash commands `zcat`, `zless`, `zmore`, and `zgrep` do.

4. (Looping in Bash) What's the output of the following bash script?
```{bash}
#| eval: false
for datafile in ~/mimic/hosp/{a,l,pa}*.gz
do
  ls -l $datafile
done
```
Display the number of lines in each data file using a similar loop. (Hint: combine linux commands `zcat <` and `wc -l`.)

5. Display the first few lines of `admissions.csv.gz`. How many rows are in this data file? How many unique patients (identified by `subject_id`) are in this data file? Do they match the number of patients listed in the `patients.csv.gz` file? (Hint: combine Linux commands `zcat <`, `head`/`tail`, `awk`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, and so on.)

6. What are the possible values taken by each of the variable `admission_type`, `admission_location`, `insurance`, and `ethnicity`? Also report the count for each unique value of these variables. (Hint: combine Linux commands `zcat`, `head`/`tail`, `awk`, `uniq -c`, `wc`, and so on; skip the header line.)

7. _To compress, or not to compress. That's the question._ Let's focus on the big data file `labevents.csv.gz`. Compare compressed gz file size to the uncompressed file size. Compare the run times of `zcat < ~/mimic/labevents.csv.gz | wc -l` versus `wc -l labevents.csv`. Discuss the trade off between storage and speed for big data files. (Hint: `gzip -dk < FILENAME.gz > ./FILENAME`. Remember to delete the large `labevents.csv` file after the exercise.)

## Q4. Who's popular in Price and Prejudice

1. You and your friend just have finished reading *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen. Among the four main characters in the book, Elizabeth, Jane, Lydia, and Darcy, your friend thinks that Darcy was the most mentioned. You, however, are certain it was Elizabeth. Obtain the full text of the novel from <http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt> and save to your local folder. 
```{bash}
#| eval: false
wget -nc http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt
```
Explain what `wget -nc` does. Do **not** put this text file `pg42671.txt` in Git. Complete the following loop to tabulate the number of times each of the four characters is mentioned using Linux commands.
```{bash}
#| eval: false
wget -nc http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/42671/pg42671.txt
for char in Elizabeth Jane Lydia Darcy
do
  echo $char:
  # some bash commands here
done
```

2. What's the difference between the following two commands?
```{bash}
#| eval: false
echo 'hello, world' > test1.txt
```
and
```{bash}
#| eval: false
echo 'hello, world' >> test2.txt
```

3. Using your favorite text editor (e.g., `vi`), type the following and save the file as `middle.sh`:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/sh
# Select lines from the middle of a file.
# Usage: bash middle.sh filename end_line num_lines
head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
```
Using `chmod` to make the file executable by the owner, and run
```{bash}
#| eval: false
./middle.sh pg42671.txt 20 5
```
Explain the output. Explain the meaning of `"$1"`, `"$2"`, and `"$3"` in this shell script. Why do we need the first line of the shell script?

## Q5. More fun with Linux

Try following commands in Bash and interpret the results: `cal`, `cal 2024`, `cal 9 1752` (anything unusual?), `date`, `hostname`, `arch`, `uname -a`, `uptime`, `who am i`, `who`, `w`, `id`, `last | head`, `echo {con,pre}{sent,fer}{s,ed}`, `time sleep 5`, `history | tail`.

## Q6. Book

1. Git clone the repository <https://github.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Book> for the book _Reproducible Research with R and RStudio_ to your local machine. 

2. Open the project by clicking `rep-res-3rd-edition.Rproj` and compile the book by clicking `Build Book` in the `Build` panel of RStudio. (Hint: I was able to build `git_book` and `epub_book` but not `pdf_book`.)

The point of this exercise is (1) to get the book for free and (2) to see an example how a complicated project such as a book can be organized in a reproducible way.

For grading purpose, include a screenshot of Section 4.1.5 of the book here.
