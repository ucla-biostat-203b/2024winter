In the next few lectures, we focus on the modeling step. We take the narrow sense of statistical/machine learning for the model step.

# Overview of statistical/machine learning

In this class, we use the phrases **statistical learning**, **machine learning**, or simply **learning** interchangeably.

## Supervised vs unsupervised learning

- **Supervised learning**: input(s) -> output. 
    - Prediction (or regression): the output is continuous (income, weight, bmi, ...).
    - Classification: the output is categorical (disease or not, pattern recognition, ...).

- **Unsupervised learning**: no output. We learn relationships and structure in the data. 
    - Clustering.   
    - Dimension reduction. 
    - Embedding.

## Supervised learning

- **Predictors**
$$
X = \begin{pmatrix} X_1 \\ \vdots \\ X_p \end{pmatrix}.
$$
Also called **inputs**, **covariates**, **regressors**, **features**, **independent variables**.

- **Outcome** $Y$ (also called **output**, **response variable**, **dependent variable**, **target**).
    - In the **regression problem**, $Y$ is quantitative (price, weight, bmi).  
    - In the **classification problem**, $Y$ is categorical. That is $Y$ takes values in a finite, unordered set (survived/died, customer buy product or not, digit 0-9, object in image, cancer class of tissue sample).  

- We have training data $(\mathbf{x}_1, y_1), \ldots, (\mathbf{x}_n, y_n)$. These are observations (also called samples, instances, cases). Training data is often represented by a predictor matrix
$$
\mathbf{X} = \begin{pmatrix}
x_{11} & \cdots & x_{1p} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{n1} & \cdots & x_{np}
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{x}_1^T \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{x}_n^T \end{pmatrix}
$$ {#eq-predictor-matrix}
and a response vector
$$
\mathbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_n \end{pmatrix}
$$

- Based on the training data, our goal is to
    - Accurately predict unseen outcome of test cases based on their predictors.  
    - Understand which predictors affect the outcome, and how.  
    - Assess the quality of our predictions and inferences. 

### Example: salary

- The `Wage` data set collects the wage and other data for a group of 3000 male workers in the Mid-Atlantic region in 2003-2009.

- Our goal is to establish the relationship between salary and demographic variables in population survey data.

- Since wage is a quantitative variable, it is a regression problem.

- The `Smarket` data set contains daily percentage returns for the S&P 500 stock index between 2001 and 2005.

- Our goal is to predict whether the index will _increase_ or _decrease_ on a given day, using the past 5 days' percentage changes in the index.

- Since the outcome is binary (_increase_ or _decrease_), it is a classification problem. 

- From the boxplots, it seems that the previous 5 days percentage returns do not discriminate whether today's return is positive or negative.

## Unsupervised learning

- No outcome variable, just predictors.  

- Objective is more fuzzy: find groups that behave similarly, find features that behave similarly, find linear combinations of features with the most variations, generative models (transformers).  

- Difficult to know how well you are doing. 

- Can be useful in exploratory data analysis (EDA) or as a pre-processing step for supervised learning.

### Example: gene expression

- The `NCI60` data set consists of 6,830 gene expression measurements for each of 64 cancer cell lines. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### R

```{r}
# NCI60 data and cancel labels
str(NCI60)
# Cancer type of each cell line
table(NCI60$labs)

# Apply PCA using prcomp function
# Need to scale / Normalize as
# PCA depends on distance measure
prcomp(NCI60$data, scale = TRUE, center = TRUE, retx = T)$x |>
  as_tibble() |>
  add_column(cancer_type = NCI60$labs) |>
  # Plot PC2 vs PC1
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = cancer_type)) +
  labs(title = "Gene expression profiles cluster according to cancer types")
```

#### Python

```{python}
# Import NCI60 data
nci60_data = pd.read_csv('../data/NCI60_data.csv')
nci60_labs = pd.read_csv('../data/NCI60_labs.csv')
nci60_data.info()
```

```{python}
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import scale

# Obtain the first 2 principal components
nci60_tr = scale(nci60_data, with_mean = True, with_std = True)
nci60_pc = pd.DataFrame(
  PCA(n_components = 2).fit(nci60_tr).transform(nci60_tr),
  columns = ['PC1', 'PC2']
  )
nci60_pc['PC2'] *= -1  # for easier comparison with R
nci60_pc['cancer_type'] = nci60_labs
nci60_pc
```

```{python}
# Plot PC2 vs PC1
sns.relplot(
  kind = 'scatter', 
  data = nci60_pc, 
  x = 'PC1',

### Example: mapping people from their genomes

- The genetic makeup of $n$ individuals can be represented by a matrix @eq-predictor-matrix, where $x_{ij} \in \{0, 1, 2\}$ is the $j$-th genetic marker of the $i$-th individual.

    Is that possible to visualize the geographic relationship of these individuals?

- Following picture is from the article [_Genes mirror geography within Europe_](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v456/n7218/full/nature07331.html) by Novembre et al (2008) published in Nature.

## No easy answer

In modern applications, the line between supervised and unsupervised learning is blurred.

### Example: the Netflix prize

::: {#fig-netflix fig-ncols=1}

![](./netflix_matrix.png){fig-align="center"}

![](./netflix_prize.png){fig-align="center"}

The Netflix challenge.
:::

- Competition started in Oct 2006. Training data is ratings for 480,189 Netflix customers $\times$ 17,770 movies, each rating between 1 and 5.

- Training data is very sparse, about 98\% sparse. 

- The objective is to predict the rating for a set of 1 million customer-movie pairs that are missing in the training data.

- Netflix's in-house algorithm achieved a root MSE of 0.953. The first team to achieve a 10\% improvement wins one million dollars.

- Is this a supervised or unsupervised problem? 

    - We can treat `rating` as outcome and user-movie combinations as predictors. Then it is a supervised learning problem.
    
    - Or we can treat it as a matrix factorization or low rank approximation problem. Then it is more of a unsupervised learning problem, similar to PCA.
    
### Example: large language models (LLMs)    

Modern large language models, such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), combine both supervised learning and reinforcement learning.

## Statistical learning vs machine learning

- Machine learning arose as a subfield of Artificial Intelligence.

- Statistical learning arose as a subfield of Statistics.

- There is much overlap. Both fields focus on supervised and unsupervised problems. 

    - Machine learning has a greater emphasis on large scale applications and prediction accuracy.
    
    - Statistical learning emphasizes models and their interpretability, and precision and uncertainty.
    
- But the distinction has become more and more blurred, and there is a great deal of "cross-fertilization".

- Machine learning has the upper hand in Marketing!
