> Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.  
> - Winston Churchill, November 10, 1942

## Where are we now?

## Checklist on your resume

> A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.  

- [ ] Linux scripting  
- [ ] Git/GitHub (give your GitHub handle)  
- [ ] Data wrangling (Tidyverse)   
- [ ] Data visualization (ggplot2)  
- [ ] Frontend development (shiny, web app)  
- [ ] Databases: OLAP (DuckDB), Google BigQuery (spend more time self-studying SQL)  
- [ ] Cloud computing (GCP, AWS, Azure, OCI) (if you use it)    
- [ ] High-performance computing (HPC) on cluster (if you use Hoffman2)  
- [ ] Deep learning with Keras+TensorFlow (PyTorch is more popular in research) (if you use it in HW5)  

* Make your GitHub repo `biostat-203b-2024-winter` public (after Apr 15, 2024) and show off your work to back your resume. Feel free to modify the reports after this course. You can make your GitHub repository into a webpage by using GitHub Pages.  

* **Use** these tools in your daily work: use Git/GitHub for all your homework and research projects, write weekly research report using Quarto/RMarkdown/Jupyter Notebook, give presentation using ggplot2 and Shiny, write blog/tutorial, ...

## What's not covered

- Machine/statistical learning methods. Familiar with methods in [_Elements of Statistical Learning_](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) and software, e.g., _scikit-learn_.

  For non-statistician, I recommend [_An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R_](https://ucla.on.worldcat.org/external-search?queryString=An%20Introduction%20to%20Statistical%20Learning#/oclc/852254203), which is less technical and more application oriented.  

- Computational algorithms. Spring quarter's Biostat 257 will cover numerical linear algebra and numerical optimization algorithms. 

- Public health applications.

- Be open to languages. **Python** is a more generic programming language and widely adopted in data science. **Julia** is attractive for high performance scientific computing. **JavaScript** is dominant in web applications. **Scala** is popular for implementing distributed programs.
